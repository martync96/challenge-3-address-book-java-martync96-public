### What benefits does this software bring to the customer?

There are a number of benefits this software can bring to users, firstly, the creation of an address book application
would allow for efficient organisation of contacts, both by keeping them in a singular application and also for allowing
users to save email addresses too, allowing for users to keep both emails and phone numbers in a singular location.
The search function also allows for users to be able to find specific contacts they are looking for quickly and
efficiently through the implementation of the search function, as opposed to a standard paper address book in which you
would have to look through alphabetically.
Again, compared to a traditional address book, this application provides additional security assuming that the users
device has a password.

### What impact will the software on the customer's business?

Launching another successful product to go alongside DFCorp's previous secret diary product will make it more attractive
to investors, due to DFCorps increasing their product line by 100%. Alongside increasing the attractiveness to invest,
it also increases the companies overall value due to the added income stream. In addition to monetary gain, there is a
level of prestige that can be built from continuously launching successful products.

The other added benefit of having two successful products is the increase of scope to harvest data, the harvested data
can be used to analyse customers behaviour to help further improve the products, for use internally for marketing and
potentially to sell to external parties.
